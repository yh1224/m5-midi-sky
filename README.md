## Installation

1. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
2. Clone this repository
3. Create `config.h` from `config.h.template`
4. Choose your target environment (see Build Environments below)
5. **Important**: For USB modes, ensure the device is in Download Mode before uploading (see https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/CoreS3)
6. Build and upload to your M5Stack device

## Build Environments

```

## Usage

### Basic Operation

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect MIDI Unit for GROVE to M5Stack's built-in GROVE port
2. **Power On**: The M5Stack will display a visual keyboard interface
3. **MIDI Input**: Connect MIDI source to the appropriate GPIO pins:
   - M5Stack Basic: RX=22, TX=21
   - M5Stack Core2: RX=33, TX=32  
   - M5Stack CoreS3: RX=1, TX=2
4. **Controller Output**: 
   - Bluetooth modes: Pair with target device
   - USB modes: Connect M5Stack CoreS3 via USB cable

### Controls

- **Button A**: Transpose down (lower pitch)
- **Button B**: Switch between mapping modes (2 different control schemes)
- **Button C**: Transpose up (higher pitch)

### MIDI Note Mapping

The system maps 15 specific MIDI notes to controller inputs:
- **Note Range**: C3 to C5 (MIDI notes 48, 50, 52, 53, 55, 57, 59, 60, 62, 64, 65, 67, 69, 71, 72)
- **Mapping**: Each controller type has its own mapping table that converts these 15 positions to specific outputs
- **Transpose**: Use Button A/C to shift the entire range up/down by semitones
